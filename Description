# Weighted Survey: Statistical Analysis of Childhood Leadership Experiences

## Project Overview
Conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis examining how gender and age influence childhood leadership experiences using nationally representative survey data. This project demonstrated advanced statistical modeling, survey methodology, and data analysis skills applied to a socially relevant research question.

## Methods and Research Design 

### Methods & Modeling:
- Implemented survey-weighted logistic regression models to analyze binary outcomes
- Applied stratified sampling techniques with proportional allocation across demographic groups
- Conducted Monte Carlo simulations (1,000 iterations) to validate sampling methodology and assess estimation precision
- Performed comparative analysis between stratified sampling and simple random sampling approaches

### EDA: 
- Processed and cleaned large-scale survey data from 5,057 respondents
- Handled complex survey weights and nonresponse adjustments
- Created binary outcome variables and categorical predictors through systematic data recoding
- Applied appropriate statistical functions (svymean(), svyby()) for survey-weighted analyses

### Research Design
- Designed stratified sampling strategy across 8 demographic strata (gender × age groups)
- Calculated optimal sample size (n=400) using statistical power analysis with 95% confidence interval and ±5% margin of error
- Implemented complex survey design accounting for population representativeness and sampling bias

## Key Findings 
- Identified significant gender disparities: women were statistically significantly less likely to report childhood leadership roles (p < 0.001)
- Discovered generational patterns: older adults (50-64 and 65+ age groups) showed significantly lower leadership rates compared to younger adults (18-29)
- Quantified the magnitude of disparities: youngest adults reported >75% leadership rates vs. only 42.7% among women aged 50-64
- Validated findings through rigorous simulation studies demonstrating methodological accuracy
